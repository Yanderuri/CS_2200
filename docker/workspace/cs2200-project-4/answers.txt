6.1 FIFO Scheduler
Run your OS simulation with 1, 2, and 4 CPUs. Compare the total execution time of each. Is there a linear relationship between the number of CPUs and total execution time? Why or why not? Keep in mind that the execution time refers to the simulated execution time.
----------
1, 2 and 4 cpus respectively
67.9s, 39.9s, 36.9s
Definitely not linear. We may save more time as we get more processes but after a certain point some cores just stay idle.

6.2 Round-Robin Scheduler
Run your Round-Robin scheduler with timeslices of 800ms, 600ms, 400ms, and 200ms. Use only one CPU
for your tests. Compare the statistics at the end of the simulation. Is there a relationship between the total waiting time and timeslice length? If so, what is it? In contrast, in a real OS, the shortest timeslice possible is usually not the best choice. Why not?
----------

800ms: 317.1s
600ms: 302.3s
400ms: 291.7s
200ms: 284.4s

6.3 Preemptive Priority Scheduler
Priority schedulers can sometimes lead to starvation among processes with lower priority. What is a way
that operating systems can mitigate starvation in a priority scheduler?
----------

Using time to factor in, so that no process ever waits forever.
Eventually, one process will have such a large time weight compared to innate priority.

6.4 Priority Inversion
Consider a non-preemptive priority scheduler. Suppose you have a high-priority process (P1) that wants to display a window on the monitor. But, the window manager is a process with low priority and will be placed at the end of the ready queue. While it is waiting to be scheduled, new medium-priority processes are likely to come in and starve the window manager process. The starvation of the window manager will also mean the starvation of P1 (the process with high priority), since P1 is waiting for the window manager to finish running. 

If we want to keep our non-preemptive priority scheduler, what edits can we make to our scheduler to ensure that the P1 can finish its execution before any of the medium priority processes finish their execution? Explain in detail the changes you would make.
----------
We can add weights to each of a process sub process as well.
Then multiply them all together.
For example
P1
    P1.1 = some weight
    P1.2 = some other weight
P2
    P2.1
    P2.2
P1.1 effective priority = P1.1 innate * P1 innate
So in this sense, P1.1 and P1.2 have a possible chance to at least elevate to medium effective priority.
